# Get Started with Sec5

## Installation

Sec5 works with just a terminal and a package manager. So you can use whatever package manager and Javascript runtime you want.

```bash copy
npm install --save-dev sec5
```

```bash copy
pnpm add -D sec5
```

```bash copy
yarn add --dev sec5
```

```bash copy
bun add -D sec5
```

## Creating config file

Sec5 also reads different config files for cross-project compatibility and ease of use.

You can create a config file with any of these names:

```
sec5.config.js
sec5.js
sec.config.js
sec.js
secure.config.js
secure.js
```
