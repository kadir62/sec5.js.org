# Configuration

Welcome to the configuration documentation for our workspace security tool. This document will guide you through configuring the tool according to your project requirements.

## Configuration File

To configure the tool, you need to create a `secure.config.js` ([Check](/docs/get-started.mdx#creating-config-file)) file in the root of your project. This file should export an object with specific configurations. Here's an example of a configuration file:

```javascript
export default {
  allowTodo: true, // Set to true to allow TODO comments
  allowNonWritedChangelog: false, // Set to true to allow non-written versions on changelog files
  allowNoVersion: false // Set to true to allow projects without a version
}
```
